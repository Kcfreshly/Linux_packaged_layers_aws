Hi Gemini

Write me a dockerfile that uses amazon 2023, python 12, and I need psycopg2 and paramiko



Create another file called docker_install.sh

This should contain the virtual environemtn and 



Next create a runner.sh

This should build the image and container and zip the new file needed for lambda layer and save in local machine



I tried building the dependecies in an ec2 instance without docker but in lambda i get the service busy or device busy err 500.



I tried previously installing the dependencies docker manually but i get the distutils not found in amazon 2023



My PC spec:

Windows.

I am using a bash terminal as powershell wont work. But bash always comes up with the directory not found error I had to divide runner.sh into 2 parts and run the docker exec with winpty



Please take note of all these situations and create the files
